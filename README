NOTE (02 Feb 2014) I've rewrote and renamed this project to "vim-textobj-quote" to emphasize its use as a text object. The former "vim-quotable" is deprecated but still available on github. -Reed

While Vim is renown for its text manipulation capabilities, it nevertheless retains a bias towards ASCII that stretches back to its vi roots on Unix. This can limit the appeal of this powerful editor for those who prefer typographic characters like curly quotes over "straight quotes" in the prose or documentation they write.

Features of this plugin:

* Automatic entry of typographic quotes from the 'straight quote' keys
* Motion support for typographic quote pairs
* Matchit % matching for typographic quote pairs
* User can define alternative typographic quote pairs
* Replace quotes in existing text, including entire buffer

The latest version of plugin, including configuration details and a brief animated demo, can be found at: https://github.com/reedes/vim-textobj-quote
